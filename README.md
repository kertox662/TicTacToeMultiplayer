To play on the server, open up the processing sketch located in TicTacToeClient. Running the sketch will connect you to the server. To continue, click the entrybox in the middle of the screen and click enter. This will set your username.

When you are in, you will get several options: Either join an existing lobby, host a lobby, or spectate a game. To join or spectate, click the lobby in the list and click the join/spectate button. To host, type in data into each of the entry boxes. The mode box refers to what is going to represent the players, either traditional X/O characters or colours. The number to connect refers to how many in a row you have to get to win.

To run a server, you must build the server using the go compiler. Simply running it will launch a server on the port 42069. You can specify a custom port by giving the program an argument when running it.

Please Note: You may need to install the Minim library for the Processing Client
